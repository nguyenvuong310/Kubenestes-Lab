# Learning objectives

- Build and run simple Node.js microservices and container images.
- Write and fix Kubernetes YAML for Deployments and Services.
- Explore K8s networking type:
  - **Container-to-Container Networking**: how containers
    within the same Pod communicate.
  - **Pod-to-Pod Networking**: how Pods communicate with each
    other across nodes.
  - **Pod-to-Service Networking**: how Pods interact with
    Services, including load balancing and discovery.
  - **Internet-to-Service Networking**: how external traffic
    reaches cluster Services.
