# Continuous Integration

## Practice

1. Review and fix issues in Kubernetes configuration files in jenkins folder.
2. Deploy **Jenkins** on a Kubernetes cluster and expose it externally using **NodePort**.
3. Create a simple **Jenkinsfile** to validate the CI pipeline following the sample folder.
4. Set up a **CI workflow between Jenkins and GitHub** so that pipelines are triggered automatically on source code changes.
