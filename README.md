# Kubernetes Labs — Step-by-step student guide

This repository contains a sequence of hands-on Kubernetes labs. Each lab folder (lab1, lab2, ...) contains the lab description and example manifests or code. This README gives students a consistent, step-by-step workflow to complete each lab, common checks, and per-lab quick-start instructions.

## Quick start (one-time)

1. Clone the repository and change into it:

```shell
git clone [<repo-url>](https://github.com/nguyenvuong310/Kubenestes-Lab.git)
cd Kubenestes-Lab
```

## General workflow for each lab

**Lab 1 — Basics / Hello Kubernetes**

Quick intro to kubectl and core primitives (Pod, Service). Deploy a simple app and inspect pods, logs and service endpoints.

**Lab 2 — Multi-component app**

Deploy a multi-component application (frontend + backends). Focus on service-to-service communication, selectors, and basic troubleshooting.

**Lab 3 — Microservices sample**

Explore a small microservice demo: frontend, service-a, service-b. Build or run sample images and apply manifests in k8s-yaml to see inter-service requests and routing.

**Lab 4 — Stateful workloads / MySQL**

Deploy MySQL with PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim. Practice creating PV/PVC, initializing a database from SQL, and validating persistent storage across pod restarts.

**Lab 5 — Practice deploy Microservices**

Hands-on tasks described in lab5.md — typically configuration validation and applying manifests; read the lab file for exact objectives and exercises.

**Lab 6 — Jenkins CI on Kubernetes**

Deploy Jenkins with a PV/PVC, expose via NodePort, create a Pipeline using the sample Jenkinsfile, run npm test for the sample app, and integrate basic GitHub triggers. Includes sample files under sample.

**Lab 7 — Deploy ArgoCD**

Deploy ArgoCD in a dedicated namespace and expose its web interface using a NodePort service.

**Lab 8 — Cluster logging (EFK stack)**

Deploy Elasticsearch (StatefulSet), Fluent Bit (DaemonSet + ConfigMap) and Kibana in the kube-logging namespace. Verify logs are collected from /var/log/containers and searchable in Kibana.

**Lab 9 — Helm fundamentals**

Learn Helm 3: scaffold a chart (helm create), use values.yaml, render templates, install/upgrade/rollback releases, lint/package charts and use local repos. Exercises scaffold a minimal myweb nginx chart.

**Lab Final — (Advanced/holistic lab)**

This final lab consolidates all knowledge and skills from previous labs into a single.
